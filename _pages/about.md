I am a researcher at Tencent Youtu Lab, where I work on computer vision and machine learning. Recently, I am working for developing Text-to-Image model of Tencent Cloud.

I got my B.A. from the Harbin Institute of Technology(HIT) in 2017 and got my M.A. degree from the Zhejiang University(ZJU) in 2020. I have ever worked at NetEase, SenseTime and Hikvision as research intern and joined Tencent Youtu Lab in 2020.
